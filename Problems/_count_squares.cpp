// Remember: geometry, think of the diagonal of the square defining the square (see "count()" below), and 
// only "de p√©" squares allowed here it seems.

// You are given a stream of points consisting of x-y coordinates on a 2-D plane. Points can be added and queried
// as follows:

// Add - new points can be added to the stream into a data structure. Duplicate points are allowed and should be 
// treated as separate points.
// Query - Given a single query point, count the number of ways to choose three additional points from the data
// structure such that the three points and the query point form a square. The square must have all sides parallel 
// to the x-axis and y-axis, i.e. no diagonal squares are allowed. Recall that a square must have four equal sides.
// Implement the CountSquares class:

// CountSquares() Initializes the object.
// void add(int[] point) Adds a new point point = [x, y].
// int count(int[] point) Counts the number of ways to form valid squares with point point = [x, y] as described above.
