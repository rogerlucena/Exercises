// Remember: you have to test all the elements j to the right of i and check LIS if nums[i] < nums[j],
// not only the next greater element to the right of i using a stack and going from right to left (gives wrong answer).
// 1D DP problem here, for memo think about memo[j] being the LIS using nums from j onwards including j.

// Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given array of integers, A.

// In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequenceâ€™s elements are in strictly increasing order, 
// and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.
// This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
// In this case, we only care about the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

// Constraints:
// 1 <= length(A) <= 2500
// 1 <= A[i] <= 2000

// Example :
// Input 1:
//     A = [1, 2, 1, 5]
// Output 1:
//     3
// Explanation 1:
//     The sequence : [1, 2, 5]

// DP: try to divide into smaller recursive problems, if overlaps -> memoization
// go from right to left, iterate through the elements to the right bigger than "curr" using "memo",
